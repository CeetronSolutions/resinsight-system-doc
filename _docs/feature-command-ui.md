## Feature Command - User Interface

Content of fields in feature command UI can be stored in a project file. This is usually done using the following code

`RiaApplication::instance()->project()->dialogData()->holoLensExportToFolderData();`

The code for UI for command features are usuallys stored next to the other classes in `ApplicationCode/Commands/...`
